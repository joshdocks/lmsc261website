<h3>Dooho</h3>
<p>
    I'm a professional washing machine player who has been in demand as a studio musician since the late 1950's. 
    I'm an expert at getting people stuck in, and unstuck from, washing machines.
     Born in 1784, I rolled out of a mountainside in Stockholm, Sweden with the sole purpose of becoming a professional washing machine player.
