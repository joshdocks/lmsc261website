<h3>Josh</h3>
<p>I started playing piano at a young age with a focus on classical music before eventually moving towards learning about jazz and its theory in middle school. Since high school and exploring other genres of music, I have become interested in more electronic-oriented types of music and am learning how to combine technology and music and meaningful, creative ways.</p><hr/>
