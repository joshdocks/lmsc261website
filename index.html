<p>Matt is a formerly world renowned mayonnaise instrumentalist that suffered severe head trauma in Stockholm, Sweden. Unfortunately, Matt has been left with amnesia and knows nothing but mayonnaise and music. Thanks to a nearby good samaritan, Matt joined MDMJ as their dedicated mayonnaisierre. Matt's burning memories of a previous life leave a mark on the music of MDMJ with songs such as <i>Men Kissing</i> and <i>I was hit in the head with a Washing Machine.</i></p><hr/>
