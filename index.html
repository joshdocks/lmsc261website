<p>Matt is a formerly world renowned mayonnaise instrumentalist that suffered severe head trauma in Stockholm, Sweden. Unfortunately, Matt has been left with amnesia and knows nothing but mayonnaise and music. Thanks to a nearby good samaritan, Matt joined MDMJ as their dedicated mayonnaisierre. Matt's burning memories of a previous life leave a mark on the music of MDMJ with songs such as <i>Men Kissing</i> and <i>I was hit in the head with a Washing Machine.</i></p>

<h3>Dooho</h3>
<p>
I'm a professional washing machine player who has been in demand as a studio musician since the late 1950's. </p> 
<p>
I'm an expert at getting people stuck in, and unstuck from, washing machines. </p> <p>
Born in 1784, I rolled out of a mountainside in Stockholm, Sweden with the sole purpose of becoming a professional washing machine player.</p> <p>Since my birth, I have been dropping my washing machine from various balconies to achieve ultimate tone.

<!-- Josh paragraph -->
<h3>Josh</h3>
<p>I started playing piano at a young age with a focus on classical music before eventually moving towards learning about jazz and its theory in middle school. Since high school and exploring other genres of music, I have become interested in more electronic-oriented types of music and am learning how to combine technology and music and meaningful, creative ways.</p><hr/>
